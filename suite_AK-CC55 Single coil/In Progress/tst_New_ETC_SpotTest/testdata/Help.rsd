""Aut"": automatical fan control"
"Fod defines the fan delay (in seconds) after a compressor cut-in."
"FSd defines the fan delay after a compressor cut-out.
If both ""Fod"" and ""FSd"" are set to zero then the fan runs whenever the
compressor runs."
"When the compressor is OFF, and ""FoC"" or ""FSC"" are not zero, the fanruns in cycles according to ""FoC"" and ""FSC"".Example: ""FoC=120"" [sec] and ""FSC=120"" [sec] means that the fan runsfor half the time when the compressor is OFF. When the compressor ison, the fan is always ON (according to ""FAo"" and ""Fod"")."

"Terminate Temperature
This parameter defines at what temperature the defrost cycle will stop.
The temperature is given by the evaporator sensor or by the cabinet
temperature sensor if no evaporator sensor is used."
"Defrost minimum Interval/dii
Defines the minimum time period between the start of two defrost cycles.
Once the minimum interval has expired, the defrost cycle will start at
the following cut-out or once the maximum interval ""dAi"" has been
reached."
"Maximum Interval
Defines the maximum time period between the start of two defrost cycles."
"Maximum Time
Defines the maximum duration of a defrost cycle.
The controller will not allow a maximum time to be entered which is
less than the minimum time, or a minimum time which is more than the
maximum time."
"Defrost start evaporator temp
Defrost start trigger for adaptive defrost."
"Defrost ON Compressor Time
If this parameter is set to ""yES"", then defrost time is considered only when compressor is ON, so that defrost cycles are based on
the total time the compressor has been running. If this parameter is set to no, then defrost cycles are related to elapsed time,
regardless of how long and how often the compressor has been on."
"Drip OFF Time
This parameter can be set to between 0 and 60 minutes and defines how long the delay is between
the heater being switched OFF and the compressor starting again."
"Fan Delay after DefrostDefines how long the delay is between the start of the compressor afterdefrost and the fan starting again."
"Fan Start Temperature
This only applies if an evaporator temperature sensor is fitted.
This parameter determines at what evaporator temperature the fan will
start after a defrost cycle is complete.
If the time set in ""Fdd"" occurs before the temperature set in ""Ftd"", the fan
will start in line with ""Fdd"". If the temperature set in ""Ftd"" occurs first,
then the fan will start in line with ""Ftd"". It is therefore a case of whichever
parameter’s setting is reached first which determines when the fan starts."
"Defrost Fan On
Set to ""yES"", the fan will constantly run during defrost cycles.
Set to ""no"", the fan will not run during defrost cycles."
"Minimum Run Time
It determines the minimum number of minutes the compressor must run
before a Temperature cut-out can take effect. For example, if the
temperature sensor indicated that the cut-out temperature has been
reached, but the number of minutes set in this parameter have not
elapsed since the compressor last started, then the compressor will
continue. It will only stop once the duration given by ""Crt"" has been
reached – provided the temperature is still low enough.
""Crt"" thus overrides the cut-out."
"Minimum Stop Time
It determines the minimum number of minutes the compressor must
remain idle before a Temperature cut-in can take effect. For example,
if the temperature sensor indicates that the cut-in temperature has been
reached, but the number of minutes set in this parameter have not elapsed
since the compressor last stopped, then the compressor will stay OFF.
It will only start once the duration given by ""CSt"" has been reached
provided the temperature is still high enough. ""CSt"" thus overrides the cut-in.

"Compressor Door Open Delay/Cdd
This parameter sets the delay in minutes before the compressor stops
when the door is opened. If set to zero, the function is disabled."
"System resume after door open
Fan and Compressor resume after cut out by door open."
"Power ON Delay
This is the delay in seconds between power-on and the compressor being
activated.
Depends on the power ON temperature setting as explained below."
"Low Temp Alarm
Absolute value.
By setting ""LAt"" to the minimum value, alarms will be deactivated.
In most situations, the low alarm delay will be set to 0 to warn about
too low a temperature immediately."
"High Temp Alarm
Absolute value.
By setting ""HAt"" to the maximum alarms will be deactivated."
"Alarm delay on low temperature alarm
The number of minutes to wait before sounding an alarm once the
low temperature alarm temperature is reached."
"Alarm delay on high temperature alarm
The number of minutes to wait before sounding an alarm once the
high temperature alarm temperature is reached."
"Pull down delay
Normally, it is not necessary or desirable to sound an alarm during a pull
down (the initial phase of reaching the desired temperature). This
parameter prevents the high temperature alarm ""HAt"" sounding during pull down
and after a defrost for the number of minutes set for the parameter.
NOTE: it does not apply to the low temperature alarm ""LAt""."
""
"Pull Down Duration
You can choose to limit the maximum pull down time. Once this time
value (max. 48 hours) is reached, pull down will stop regardless of
whether the desired pull-down temperature has been reached."
""
"Pull Down Limit Temperature
This parameter sets the minimum allowed temperature during pull-down.
In order to protect valuable contents you must always specify the absolute
minimum temperature allowed in your application.
For glass door merchandisers 0°C/32°F protects bottles from freezing;
for commercial fridges you may opt for a slightly higher temperature
(e.g. 2°C)"
"Door delay

"ECO ON/OFF
ECO active or not. If no all other settings are not active."
"""uLi"": when the compressor is due to start, the voltage of the power
supply will be checked and the compressor will only be allowed to
start if it is at least the value given in this parameter."
"""uLo"": when the compressor is running, it will be switched
OFF if the voltage goes below that given in this
parameter."
"""uHi"": when the compressor is running, it will be switched
OFF if the voltage exceeds that given in this parameter.
If the compressor is already stopped, it will remain
switched OFF."
"Voltage protection
""no"": no voltage protection.
""yES"": voltage protection activated based on voltage related settings."
"Condenser Alarm Limit/CAL
This parameter sets the temperature for the condenser at which an alarm
will be generated.Note: Use only whole number."
"Condenser Block Limit/CbL
This parameter sets the temperature which if reached will cause the
compressor to switch OFF.Note: Use only whole number."
"Condenser OK Limit/CoL
This parameter sets the temperature at which the compressor is
allowed to start again after the temperature set in ""CbL"" above has been
exceeded and the compressor stopped.Note: Use only whole number."

"Initial Defrost Interval
The initial defrost interval determines the time for first defrost after
power-up. The initial defrost is mainly intended for factory testing of the
defrost functionality and can be set to expire after a number compressor
cycles according to the setting of parameter idd. During normal operation,
the defrost counter will be saved in memory and restored after power loss,
making the initial defrost unnecessary."
"Initial Defrost Duration
The initial defrost duration is the number of compressor cycles before
the initial defrost is deactivated.
""0"": ""idi"" No initial defrost.
""1-998"": number of compressor cycles before deactivation.
""999"": initial defrost always active."
"Door Open delay
It is possible to indicate to customers that a door has accidentally been
left open. This parameter sets the delay in minutes before the alarm sounds.
This is useful in environments where customers/users may hold the door
open while making their selection. If the door is closed again before
the set number of minutes is reached, the alarm does not sound.
NOTE: a door sensor is required if this parameter is to be activated."
