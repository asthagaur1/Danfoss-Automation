changed. This parameter determines how long in minutes an audible
alarm will continue while there is still a reason to have an alarm.
If set to 999, the alarm will continue to sound until the reason for the
alarm is cleared – for example the temperature has dropped enough or
the door closed. In some cases, it may be necessary for a user or technician
to take action in order to clear the alarm. If set to 0, the alarm will never
sound."
