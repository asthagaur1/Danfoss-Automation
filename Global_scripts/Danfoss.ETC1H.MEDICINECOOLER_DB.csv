This parameter enhaces the relay life and also avoid relay sparks during relay on and off.This parameter is normally set to 0, which means, that the relay will be switched on and off when the line-voltage crosses zero. Hovewer, if you exactly know the power-factor of your load, you can adjust the switching time to compensate for that. "

,Voltage,0,0,0,V,,"if RST parameter is set to zero, the temperature would be displayed immediately as it is read from the sensor.  If set to any other value for example 10, ETP R1 would sample the temperature every ten seconds and moving average of 20 samples would be calculated. So if there is a temperature change, the ETPR1 would take 20 multiplied by 10 seconds i.e., 200 Secs(Max) to reach the exact temperature.
