""Selection of defrost method
1. No Defrost: Select this option if you don't need defrost functionality. If this option is selected, it will disable all defrost related parameters.

2. Start by Time, Stop by Cabinet temperature: Select this option, if you want to start defrost after fixed specified accumulated compressor run time intervals, and stop the defrost when the desired Cabinet temperature (measures by temperature/ cabinet sensor) is reached as set in the Defrost Terminate temperatur (DTT) parameter.

3. Start by Time, Stop by Evaporator temperature: Select this option, if you want to start defrost after fixed specified accumulated compressor run time intervals, and stop the defrost when the desired evaporator temperature (measures by evaporator sensor) is reached as set in the Defrost Terminate temperatur (DTT) parameter.

4. Start and Stop by Evaporator temperature: Select this option, if you want to start and stop the defrost based on evaporator temperature.
