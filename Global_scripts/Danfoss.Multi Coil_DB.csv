With this setting refrigeration can be started, stopped or a manual override of the outputs can be allowed. (For manual control the value is set at -1. Then the outputs can be force controlled. Start / stop of refrigeration can also be accomplished with the external switch function connected to a DI input.
Stopped control will give a ”Main switch OFF"" alarm.",0,Id_1048586,0,1,,1048586,S,N,[],0
